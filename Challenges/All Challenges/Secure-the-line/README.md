Title: "Secure the Line"

Doc Brown has invented a new device that can send Marty McFly's consciousness back in time to his younger self. However, the device is not functioning properly and has accidentally sent Marty's consciousness to an alternate timeline where he is stuck in a phone booth with a ringing phone.

As Marty tries to figure out how to escape, he notices that the phone is ringing in a specific pattern: "ring ring ring ring". He realizes that this is the key to unlocking the device and returning to his own timeline.

Can you help Marty solve the puzzle and find the flag?
